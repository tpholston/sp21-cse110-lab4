1. the bug is an ignorance to type of input. Generally input is saved as a string and when strings are added together, the contents of some string 2 are appended to that of string 1. This is clear as the return type of result is typeof string
2. I used parseInt so the numbers only work with whole numbers but if you wanted to make it work with decimals you could use ParseFloat
